# Signal-Generator-using-8051-Microcontroller

➼ **OBJECTIVE**

To build a signal generator that generates different types of waveforms using 8051 microcontroller.

➼ **ABSTRACT**

Signal generator that generates different shapes of waveforms over a wide range of frequencies, is an important instrument in testing and operating different kinds of electrical equipments. It can provide a wide range of controlled amplitudes, and maintain constant amplitude as the frequency is varied. 
It is widely used in engineering applications especially in control field. A common feature of a microcontroller based signal generator allows the user to select a waveform type (sine, square, and triangle) and to select the waveform frequency and amplitude. In this project, 8051 microcontroller is used to generate the signal and to display the frequency and the amplitude of the generated signal.

➼ **OVERVIEW**

In our project, the letters “SIGNAL GENERATOR” are first displayed on the 16*2 LCD display. 
Next, a user needs to press a number on the keypad. If the user presses 1, 2 or 3, a triangular wave, a square wave, and a sine wave is generated respectively.
All the waves will be displayed after clicking on the DAC (Digital Analog Converter) button on the EdSim51 simulator.

➼ **SIMULATOR USED**

• The EdSim51 is a popular simulator for 8051 microcontroller.

• A virtual 8051 is interfaced with virtual peripherals such as a keypad, motor, display, UART, etc., In this, we can write 8051 assembly code, step through the code and observe the effects each line has on the internal memory and the external peripherals.

• One major advantage of using EdSim51 simulator is that it shows graphical representations of peripherals that can be used interactively to communicate with the 8051.


➼ **SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS**

   **Software:**

   • EdSim51 Simulator
  
   • Windows 7 or above
